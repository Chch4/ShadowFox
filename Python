# Task 1: Variables

# 1. Variable named pi
pi = 22 / 7
print("Value of pi:", pi)
print("Data type of pi:", type(pi))

# 2. Variable called 'for' (this will cause SyntaxError since 'for' is a reserved keyword)
# for = 4  # Uncommenting this will throw error
print("Reason: 'for' is a reserved keyword in Python and cannot be used as a variable name.")

# 3. Simple Interest Calculation
P = 1000  # principal amount
R = 5     # rate of interest
T = 3     # time in years
SI = P * R * T / 100
print("Simple Interest:", SI)
