# Task 1: Variables

# 1. Variable named pi
pi = 22 / 7
print("Value of pi:", pi)
print("Data type of pi:", type(pi))

# 2. Variable called 'for' (this will cause SyntaxError since 'for' is a reserved keyword)
# for = 4  # Uncommenting this will throw error
print("Reason: 'for' is a reserved keyword in Python and cannot be used as a variable name.")

# 3. Simple Interest Calculation
P = 1000  # principal amount
R = 5     # rate of interest
T = 3     # time in years
SI = P * R * T / 100
print("Simple Interest:", SI)

# Task 2: Numbers

# 1. Format function
result = format(145, 'o')  # 'o' formats integer into octal
print("Formatted result (octal):", result)

# 2. Area of circular pond
radius = 84
area = 3.14 * (radius ** 2)
print("Area of pond:", area)

# Water in pond
water = int(area * 1.4)  # liters (no decimal)
print("Total water in pond (liters):", water)

# 3. Speed calculation
distance = 490  # meters
time_minutes = 7
time_seconds = time_minutes * 60
speed = int(distance / time_seconds)  # no decimal
print("Speed in m/s:", speed)
